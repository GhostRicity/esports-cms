A key element to the Erasmus + project Gaming for Boosting School Engagement for Students with Learning Disabilities is to have local tournaments to demonstrate the benefits to non gamers. With schools closed and most activities prohibited, gaming virtually is one of the few remaining ways that young people can stay involved and active.

[Hodina H](https://bit.ly/2WRLJZx) in the Czech Republic organized a three day tournament that engaged four teams in a double elimination tournament. The games were hard fought,  engaged, and shared via live stream.

Congratulations to Sokol Kosetice for taking the cup home and writing history as the first Hodina H League of Legends champs.
