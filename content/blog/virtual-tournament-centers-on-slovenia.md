Covid-19 has limited us all, but the project must go on. Our partners [SPTŠ Murska Sobota](https://www.facebook.com/sptsmsobota) coordinated an international virtual tournament on Sept. 30 - Oct. 1.

## **Getting to know you**

We started on Sept. 29 with a zoom getting-to-know-you session where we met the players from all eight teams and heard a talk about the research that we did together. Eva Birzniece shared a summary of the work and we agreed that the project is valuable in helping to find ways to engage students with learning disabilities in school. 

## **Day one brought intense battles**

We all joined battle. We had eight games on day one and you can find the twitch stream [here](https://www.twitch.tv/sptsms). The games were generally well matched and our players were energetic.

## Crowning a champ

On day two we fought another eight games and found that the Czech first team was the best. Great games and fun was had. \
