On November 26, Eva Birzniece from the Latvian Dyslexia Association presented our project to an audience of Latvian school leaders and others interested in Erasmus projects and development. The presentation highlighted the importance of the project, our tournaments, and the key digital tools and platforms that we use in the project.

Eva described our use of Agile and various communications platforms as ways that our project is innovative and really needed in today's distributed environment. The presentation also gave some of the initial feedback that we have gotten.
